# Services

At Subspace Systems, we leverage over two decades of deep technical expertise to provide specialized consulting and contracting services that drive innovation, optimize performance, and ensure the resilience of complex systems. Our founder, Tyrel Haveman, personally brings a unique blend of low-level mastery, high-performance architecture, and safety-critical industry experience to every client engagement.

We help organizations solve their most challenging technical problems, offering services across the full spectrum of software and systems development:

### 1. Software & Systems Architecture Consulting
* **Strategic System Design:** Architecting new, complex systems from concept to implementation, ensuring scalability, reliability, and maintainability.
* **Architectural Review & Optimization:** Assessing existing system architectures, identifying bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, and areas for improvement, then providing actionable recommendations.
* **Technical Leadership & Guidance:** Providing expert guidance to engineering teams, overseeing SDLC processes, and ensuring best practices in software development and quality.

### 2. High-Performance Data Systems & Cloud Optimization
* **Scalable Data Solutions:** Designing and implementing robust data models and systems capable of handling massive ingestion rates and petabytes of data, ensuring rapid data availability and analysis.
* **Database Performance Tuning:** Optimizing PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, and other database systems for peak performance in high-volume environments.
* **Cloud HPC Automation (AWS):** Building and refining cloud infrastructure for high-performance computing workloads, focusing on efficiency, cost optimization, and automated deployments (e.g., CloudFormation, EC2, S3).

### 3. Embedded Systems & Low-Level Development
* **Custom Embedded Software:** Developing tailored software for embedded devices, including firmware, device drivers, and real-time operating system components.
* **Operating System Development:** Deep expertise in bootloaders, kernels, filesystems, and memory managers for x86, AMD64, and ARM architectures.
* **Sensor Integration & Data Acquisition:** Designing and implementing robust systems for collecting and processing data from a multitude of sensors in challenging environments (e.g., high-speed telemetry, power management for off-grid systems).

### 4. Aerospace & Safety-Critical Software
* **Aviation Systems Software:** Specialization in instrumentation, telemetry, and control systems for electric aircraft, including high-speed radio protocols and data handling from thousands of sensors.
* **Compliance & Reliability:** Leveraging introductory exposure to aerospace standards (DO-178C, ARP4754B) to ensure the development of highly reliable and verifiable software for critical applications.
* **Complex System Integration:** Expertise in integrating diverse hardware and software components into cohesive, functioning systems for aerospace and other safety-critical domains.

### 5. Legacy System Modernization & Refactoring
* **Codebase Transformation:** Strategically modernizing outdated codebases (e.g., Java 1.4 to Java 8, C++ migrations) to improve performance, maintainability, and security.
* **Development Pipeline Optimization:** Overhauling and implementing modern DevOps infrastructure (e.g., migrating from Jenkins/Perforce to GitLab CI) to significantly reduce build times and enhance developer efficiency.
* **Security & Threat Analysis:** Conducting rigorous security threat analysis for entire products and features, implementing robust security measures (Crypto API, OpenSSL, SSH, SFTP), and addressing compliance (HIPAA).

### 6. Specialized Software Development
* **C++, C, Java, Kotlin, Python, C#:** Full-stack development capabilities across a wide array of languages and frameworks, adaptable to diverse project requirements.
* **Battery Simulation & Modeling:** Developing high-fidelity simulation software for complex systems like aircraft batteries, including detailed electrical and thermal modeling.
